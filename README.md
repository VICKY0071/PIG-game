# PIG-game
This is my first java script project I made..

# RULES:
* The rules are simple.  
Two players may compete.  
The first player to reach specified points or more is the winner.  
When it is your turn, you roll. If you get a 1 in the dice, then you pass the dice onto the next player.  
If you get anything else, you may decide to roll again or pass the dice.  
If you keep rolling again, you accumulate points to add to your bank but if you get a one, then all your points accumulated this turn are nullified.
